### By CARL V. LEWIS

A data jam is a technically oriented workshop exercise where people solve problems using data sets. The events can produce visual data, analytics and applications.[1]

Examples include the Hudson Data Jam, hosted by Cary Institute of Environmental Systems, in which students are asked to tell a story based on raw data collected from the watershed of the Hudson River[2] and the Capitol Code, a data jam based on the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State.[3]
